      <p>I really don't know how to start this off. Ive spent months? weeks? trying to figure out what gift I should give you. I'm not fond of this type of stuff. I'm bad at making decisions, especially when it comes to gifting. I've thought of tons of stuff I could give you, yet I'm sure you already have it all. But when you said that if someone gave you a letter, you'd keep it forever, well, since you never specified if it was a handwritten letter, I just coded it instead heeheh (jk, i just hate my handwritting its the thought that counts tho)
        I know that I sort of have an enthusiasm for writing, so here I am now writing this. I know things have been rough for us these past few weeks, and I know that things haven't been easy, but I want to give you all of my assurance that no matter what happens, I will always be here and that I will always love you. No matter what, I will always be by your side, omkie? You're the reason why I started writing again. I used to write paragraphs describing how badly they hurt me in the most painful way, but now I am writing for a different purpose. I never thought that I would come back to writing, but here I am. hehehheh
        I'm going to keep this page short because there's really nothing more for me to say. Hehe</p>
      <blockquote>There is too much choice and so deciding what to pick, where to start, can be panic inducing as the consumer – before it is too late, before we are dead</blockquote>
