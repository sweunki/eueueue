      <p>I know we are still young, still learning, still discovering new things, and still meeting new people, but being with you and feeling the warmth of your love just feels so different from any other feeling. I want to be trapped by your love and never escape. I want to be with you every day. I don't want to be in a world where there's no us. I want our love, it's soft and comforting but also so deep and emotional that there's nothing else I could ask for more of.</p>
      <blockquote>“I vow to fiercely love you in all your forms, now and forever. I promise to never forget that this is a once in a lifetime love.”
</blockquote>
      <p>I want to grow old with you; I want to achieve our dreams together; and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. It may seem so early for me to say all of this, but I mean it. My love for you is ineffable; no words can ever express how much I love you. I know I have my shortcomings as your partner, but I want you to know that I love you with all of my heart.</p>
<blockquote>“I’ve come here with no expectations, only to profess, now that I am at liberty to do so, that my heart is, and always will be, yours.”
</blockquote>
<p>I'm really proud of you, baby. You've come this far. Who knows how much more you'll achieve in the future? I hope you don't forget to appreciate yourself. I know there are rough days, but please don't forget to rest and don't be too harsh on yourself. You're doing really great, baby. Im so proud of you.<p>
<blockquote>"I would rather have had one breath of her hair, one kiss of her mouth, one touch of her hand, than eternity without it. One."
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think I said enough, but I love you. I really do. I love you with all of me, and I'm really thankful for having you in my life. Thank you for sharing the kindest and softest form of love with me, baby. You'll always have my soul. May this be a reminder to you of what you are to me, my solace, my own vision of wedding aisles, my end game, and my constant. I love you.<p>
